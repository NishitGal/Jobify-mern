Jobify â€“ Job Tracking and Management Web App
Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, Jobify is a full-featured job management platform where users can:

Create Accounts: Sign up and log in securely with individual user profiles.
Post Jobs: Users can create and manage job listings with essential details.
Search for Jobs: Efficient job search functionality to help users find the perfect match.
Track Job Stats: Visualize job-related statistics, track application status, and monitor progress.
This project highlights my full-stack development skills, including building RESTful APIs, integrating MongoDB for data storage, and creating dynamic, responsive UI with React.
